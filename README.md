## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜ƒ

I'm Kennedy **(k3nkreate)**, a graduate of Agricultural and Bioresources Engineering, with a strong background in Farm Power, Machinery, and Mechatronics. I'm currently an MSc. student in Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering at the University of Leeds, and I'm dedicated to developing innovative solutions that helps reduce drudgery in human activities.

I have worked on exciting projects that involve:
- Building autonomous systems for site-specific management and optimization of agricultural resources
- Predicting flooding potential in the Khala community using weather data.

In the future, I hope to work on projects that involve:
- Exploring possibilities and various scope in robotics via community changing projects.
- Developing machine learning models for precision farming and crop monitoring. 
- Designing and implementing AI-powered robotics for automated farming systems.
- Exploring the applications of blockchain technology in agriculture for secure and transparent supply chain management.


Feel free to explore my repositories and get in touch with me to collaborate on projects that align with our shared interests!
